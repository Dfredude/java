# Self-test questions

## 1. Arrays are contigously allocated memory elements of homogeneous data types. Explain in your own words what that means.
>  Contiguosly because the data is structured one after the other. Homogeneous because it contains within it only one data type.

## 2. What is the difference between arrays of primitive types vs. arrays of reference types?
> Arrays of primitive types are initialized to their default values, wheras reference types are initialized to **null**

## 3. Java array types directly subclass what Java class?
> java.lang.object

## 4. Java array type has a corresponding object of this type in memory. What type is it?
> PENDING

## 5. What two interfaces do Java array types implement?
> - List<E>


## 6. How do you determine the length of an array?
> Using the **`length`** attribute, such as in `<array>.length`
 and returns an int.

## 7. Java multidimensional arrays are `___` of `___`
> arrays | arrays

## 8. When a multidimensional array is created which dimensions are optional and which dimensions are mandatory?
> The most inner arrays dimension is not mandatory, the rest are indeed.

## 9. What is meant by the term "ragged array"?
> Multidimensional array having row lengths of varying sizes. They are easily created using array literals.

## 10. What is the purpose of the main method String array?
> It declares the parameters that the application method accepts from the command line. In this case an array of strings.
